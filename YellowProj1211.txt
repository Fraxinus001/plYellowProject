Discussion : Code demonstration

In today's activity we've discussed on the improvements
 and beautification of the code in preparation for the 
upcoming demonstration of the project in Dec. 15. 
In addition of our classmates get to test and evaluate our project/code, 
with that said our group conformed to make the code more compact 
by reducing lines and replacing them by import prompts and other commands.
 In conclusion we've managed to finish the project ahead of the given due
 and prepare ourselves for the finals week and the upcoming demonstration.
