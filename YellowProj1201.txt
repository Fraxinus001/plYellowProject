Discussion: Proj. Code Improvisation

Problems Ecountered: One of the problems we've encountered as a team is that whether to commit
or omit additional commands that may improve the code or make the code complicated.  Second is the 
improvisation  and beautification of the  intial code uploaded. 

Solution: As a group we chose to omit additional commands that will make the code complicated
and difficult for us to work on. And we also chose to conform with each other, the opinions we've
shared through chat leaded us to a better understanding of the strucutre of our very own work(code)
