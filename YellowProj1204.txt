Discussion: Proj. Code Beautification

Problems Ecountered: One of the problems we've encountered as a team is that how can we improve the
readability of the code for it to be user friendly and what are the commands and  statements we are going to omit 
to achieve our goal to make the code more pleasing to the user

Solution: We modified some actions and commands that are previously  done to make the code more pleaasing to the user.
also we added some new commands in dealing with the repetition of action to be done.
